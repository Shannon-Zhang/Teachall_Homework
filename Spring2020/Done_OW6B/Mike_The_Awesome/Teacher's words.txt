Thank you to them and the parents.
"Mikey, I can't really say anything about, he's a, yeah, he is A Jem, obviously. Great potential, and he can do Great things, Definitely,so that's Mikey. Not much left to say. You know, he alway left the class and solve those problems when there's nobody else. So, Awesome kid, definitely, he's definitely my Number One."  ！ Markus.

"For Jason, I've been surprised sometimes when he's been able to do certain things. But I think he needs to improve, you know, his problem I think begins with his lack of interest, I think he should improve in the department, you will know it if you are interested.  His surprise that he's been able to pull shows that he has great potential. If I was him, I would tap in the potential." ！ Markus.

"Max, on enough, also has great potential, participate more than Jason at least, so I think if he takes this class more seriously, it will help him a great deal." ！ Markus.

"George, is very good, except in those last weeks, I really don't know what happened to him. I think I'll put George next to Mikey. He is pretty smart,and quite knowledgable as far as English language concerned. But he's been absent-minded, and rather passive lately, I wish he will come back. " ！ Markus.
